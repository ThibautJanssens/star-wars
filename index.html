                <p>In a street far far away. There was once a group of people with superpowers named the BeCoders. They
                    had an inherent jutsu which consists of styling everything they saw.</p>

                <p>As all superheroes they had fearful enemies, the mighty duo called compiler and bugFinding.</p>

                <p>In order to upgrade their jutsu to face their enemies, they went on a journey 7 months long to
                    sharpen
                    their
                    skills and temper themselves.
                    During 7 months they would face the most dreadful and nerve-wrecking compiler and bugFinding.
                    But to persevere through this ordeal they had a secret weapon: coffee.</p>

                <p>They gained the knowledge to brew the most delicious and savourous coffee and drink that magic
                    potion up
                    to
                    30 cups a day.
                    All their enemies were trembling in fear only by hearing the coffee brewer starting. They just knew
                    they'll
                    be shaken hours long.</p>

                <p>During their self-control training, they came to know others weapons such as html, css and
                    javascript,
                    google and stackoverflow. But, as they learn more taijutsu, the enemies were becoming more numerous
                    and
                    resistant to their powers. So that to improve their coffee skills they had to ask for help to
                    recruit
                    new
                    Juniors wanting to progress and become BeCoders aswell.</p>
